# Here are my answers to the questions in the pdf:

1. I can estimate each line with the O-Notation and then combine the estimation for the whole program. I can simulate multiple clients and measure the CPU usage and memory consumption via terminal.
2. I select third-party libraries based on the following criteria:
    - does the library solve my problem?
    - is the library secure?
    - is the support for the library guaranteed or soon to be deprecated?
    - are there more efficient implementations?
3. Pros:
    - scalable
    - secure (docker containers are isolated from each other and placed in a sandbox)
    - standardized for all users
    - works well with other tools (e.g. Jenkins)
   Cons:
    - overhead (docker needs some setup, and also the run speed of an application decreases when running in a container.)
    - 
4. I have an idea: Use delta compression for sending patches. Let the application run on the station while downloading. Have multiple nodes that can run the application. One node can update while another runs.
5. I have never worked with databases before, but after reading a bit I found that people often send multiple queries with a single request each instead of batching queries.
    If that was the case, I would group multiple queries together into a single query for multiple items.
